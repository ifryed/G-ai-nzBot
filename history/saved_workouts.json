        "workout": "Here's a simple yet effective bodyweight workout with three exercises:\n\n1. Squats\n   - Stand tall with your feet hip-width apart.\n   - Keeping your weight in your heels, sit back as if you're sitting into an imaginary chair.\n   - Keep your knees from extending past your toes and maintain proper form throughout the movement.\n   - Complete 3 sets of 15-20 repetitions.\n\n2. Push-ups\n   - Start in a high plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders, body in a straight line from head to heels.\n   - Keeping your elbows tucked close to your sides, lower your chest towards the ground.\n   - Push back up to the starting position.\n   - Modify this exercise by performing them on your knees if needed. Complete 3 sets of 10-15 repetitions.\n\n3. Plank\n   - Begin in a high plank position as described above.\n   - Engage your core and keep your body in a straight line, maintaining proper form throughout the hold.\n   - Hold for 20-60 seconds, then rest briefly before repeating.\n   - Complete 3 sets with gradually increasing hold times.",
